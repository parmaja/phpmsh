PHP Multi Syntax Highlighter
============================

phpMSH is a syntax highlighter will "beautify" PHP, Pascal, Delphi,
Applescript, CPP, VB, and D source code.

It does not use pcre function or ereg functions , and allows  syntax code continually
line by line to reduce memory usage.

You can write your favorite code syntax, however keep in mind not use long
string variables to prevent large memory usage or crashing.  If you wish,
send me list of Keywords and string rules with samples and email them to me.
I will make a new class to support your favorite language and send add them
to the package.
